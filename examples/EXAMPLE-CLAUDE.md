## About Me
I'm Noah. I run a marketing agency that helps soccer and basketball academies (and other sports facilities) market their business locally using Facebook ads. I help them grow — that's the whole thing.

## My Audience
Sports facility owners — soccer trainers, basketball academies, all sports really. They're running businesses doing $15K-$20K/month. They're great at coaching but they suck at marketing on social media. They need my help to get more athletes in the door.

## My Voice & Style
Casual and confident. Borderline extremely unprofessional. I cuss a lot and say dumb things. I talk like a real person, not a corporate robot. My clients are coaches, not Fortune 500 execs — so I keep it real.

## Tools I Use
- Facebook & Instagram (organic + paid)
- Meta Ads Manager (where I live)
- GoHighLevel (CRM + client management)
- Canva (creative / graphics)
- Google Sheets (reporting + tracking)

## Current Focus
Automating my whole ad reporting workflow. Right now it's manual and takes forever — I want Claude Code to pull ad data, generate reports, and make my life easier so I can focus on getting results for my clients.
