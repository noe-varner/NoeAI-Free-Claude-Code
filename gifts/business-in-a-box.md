## 1. 30-Day Content Calendar

```
Build me a complete 30-day content calendar starting from today. For each day include:

- Content type (tutorial, hot take, behind-the-scenes, case study, engagement post, story-only)
- Platform (pick the best one for each piece)
- Hook (the actual first line — make it scroll-stopping)
- Topic angle (one sentence describing the content)
- CTA (what I want people to do after watching/reading)

Mix up the types so it doesn't feel repetitive. Weight it toward what performs best for my niche. Include 2 "rest days" per week where I only post stories.

Format as a clean table. Make every hook something I'd actually say.
```

## 2. Client Onboarding Workflow

```
Build me a complete client onboarding workflow for my business. Include:

2. **Onboarding form** — 10-15 questions I need answered to do great work for them. Include the questions.
3. **Kickoff call agenda** — what to cover in the first call (30 min). Include talking points.
4. **Week 1 checklist** — everything that needs to happen in the first 7 days. Task list format.
5. **Client communication templates** — 3 templates: progress update, deliverable ready, and check-in.
6. **Offboarding email** — for when the engagement ends. Professional, leaves door open.

Write everything in my voice. Make it feel personal, not corporate. These should be ready to copy-paste and use immediately.
```

1. **Hero headline + sub-headline** — the big promise
2. **Problem section** — 3-5 pain points my audience feels (written so they think "that's ME")
3. **Agitation** — what happens if they DON'T solve this problem
4. **Solution intro** — introduce my offer as the answer
5. **What's included** — bullet list of everything they get, with benefit-driven descriptions

7. **FAQ section** — 7 questions with answers that handle objections
8. **Pricing section** — present [YOUR PRICE] with value stack showing what it's worth
9. **Final CTA** — urgency + the button text + one last persuasive line

## 4. 5-Email Welcome Sequence

```
Write a complete 5-email welcome sequence for new subscribers/leads. Each email should include: subject line, preview text, full body copy, and CTA.

**Email 1 (Day 0):** Welcome + Quick Win
Deliver on whatever they signed up for. Give them an immediate win. Make them glad they subscribed.

**Email 2 (Day 2):** My Story
Why I do what I do. The origin story. Make it relatable and human. Build trust.

**Email 3 (Day 4):** The Biggest Mistake
The #1 mistake people in my audience make. Teach them something valuable. Position myself as the guide.

**Email 4 (Day 7):** Case Study / Proof
Show a result. Real or hypothetical — but make it specific. Numbers, timeline, transformation.

**Email 5 (Day 10):** The Soft Pitch
Introduce my offer naturally. Not pushy. "If you want help with this, here's what I built." Low-pressure CTA.

Write in my voice. Each email should be 150-300 words. Subject lines should get opened — test curiosity, specificity, and personal tone.
```

## 5. Social Media Bio Pack

```
Write optimized bios for all my platforms. For each one, follow the platform's best practices:

1. **Instagram bio** (150 chars max) — what I do, who I help, CTA, relevant emoji
2. **TikTok bio** (80 chars max) — ultra-punchy version
3. **Twitter/X bio** (160 chars max) — personality + credibility
4. **LinkedIn headline** (120 chars) — professional but not boring
5. **LinkedIn summary** (3 paragraphs) — my story, what I do, who I help, CTA
6. **YouTube channel description** (1 paragraph) — what viewers can expect, upload schedule, CTA

Give me 3 versions of each so I can pick my favorite. Write in my voice — not generic influencer speak.
```

---

## 6. Weekly Newsletter Template

```
Build me a reusable weekly newsletter template. Include the structure and write the first edition as an example.

**Template structure:**
1. **Subject line formula** — give me 5 formulas I can rotate weekly
2. **Opening hook** — 2-3 sentences that pull them in (not "Happy Monday!")
3. **Main insight** — the one thing I want them to learn this week (3-4 paragraphs)
4. **Quick wins** — 2-3 actionable tips they can use today (bullet format)
5. **What I'm working on** — behind-the-scenes personal update (2-3 sentences)
6. **CTA** — one clear ask (reply, check out, share, buy)
7. **P.S.** — one more thing (link, announcement, or personality moment)

Write the first edition about [TOPIC]. Make it feel like an email from a friend, not a newsletter from a brand.
```

## 7. Lead Magnet + Landing Page

```
Build me a complete lead magnet package:

**Part 1 — The Lead Magnet**
Create a [CHOOSE: checklist / cheat sheet / template / mini-guide] about [TOPIC]. It should:
- Solve one specific problem for my audience
- Be consumable in under 5 minutes
- Make them think "if the free stuff is this good, the paid stuff must be insane"
- Include 1 subtle mention of my paid offer
Write the FULL content. Not an outline — the actual deliverable.

**Part 2 — The Landing Page Copy**
Write the landing page that promotes this lead magnet:
- Headline that sells the transformation
- 3 bullet points of what they'll learn
- "What you'll get" section
- Social proof line
- Email capture CTA
- Below-the-fold: preview of what's inside

Both in my voice. Ready to use.

2. **Executive summary** — 3-4 sentences on what I'll do and the expected outcome
3. **The problem** — what they're struggling with (written to show I understand their world)

5. **What's included** — detailed deliverables list with descriptions
6. **Timeline** — phase-by-phase timeline with milestones
7. **Investment** — pricing section with [PLACEHOLDER] amounts. Include value framing.

9. **Next steps** — exactly what happens when they say yes
10. **Terms** — basic terms placeholder (payment schedule, revision policy)

Write it professionally but still in my voice. Include [BRACKETS] for parts I need to customize per client.
```

## 9. FAQ Page (10 Questions with Answers)

```
Write a complete FAQ page for my business with 10 questions and answers.

The questions should be the ones my audience ACTUALLY asks — not generic "what are your hours" stuff. Think:
- Questions that reveal objections ("Is this worth the money?")
- Questions that show confusion ("How is this different from [competitor]?")
- Questions that show interest ("How fast can I see results?")
- Questions that show fear ("What if it doesn't work for me?")
- Questions about logistics ("How does it work exactly?")

Each answer should be 3-5 sentences. Handle the objection, provide reassurance, and end with confidence. Write in my voice — casual, direct, honest.

Format with proper H3 headers for each question.
```

---

## 10. Competitor Analysis Report

```
Research and build me a competitive analysis report. Analyze my market position based on everything you know about my business.

**Section 1: My Positioning**
- What I do and who I serve (from my CLAUDE.md)
- My unique angle / differentiator
- My current strengths and weaknesses

**Section 2: Market Landscape**
- Who are the main players in my space? (research the web)
- What's the standard offering and pricing?
- Where is the market headed?

**Section 3: Competitor Breakdown** (research 3-5 competitors)
For each:
- What they offer
- Their pricing (if public)
- Their messaging and positioning
- Their content strategy
- Their strengths and weaknesses

**Section 4: Opportunities**
- Gaps in the market I could fill
- Messaging angles competitors are missing
- Underserved segments of my audience
- 3 specific actions I should take based on this analysis

Make it thorough. I want to actually USE this for strategic decisions.
```
