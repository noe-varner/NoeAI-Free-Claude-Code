# 5 Agent Workflows

Copy-paste multi-agent recipes for Claude Code. Each one spawns multiple agents working in parallel — you get everything back at once instead of waiting one by one.

**How to use:** Copy a recipe below. Paste it into Claude Code. Fill in the [BLANKS]. Watch the team work.

## 1. Competitor Deep Dive

Researches 3 competitors at the same time and gives you a comparison.

```
I need you to research 3 competitors in parallel. Spawn 3 agents — one for each competitor. Here are the competitors:

1. [COMPETITOR 1 NAME OR URL]
2. [COMPETITOR 2 NAME OR URL]
3. [COMPETITOR 3 NAME OR URL]

Each agent should research their competitor and report back:
- What they sell and to whom
- Their pricing (if public)
- Their content strategy (platforms, frequency, style)
- Their strongest messaging / unique angle
- Their weaknesses or gaps

After all 3 agents report back, give me a comparison table and tell me: what are they doing that I'm NOT, and where do I have an advantage?

## 2. Content Blitz

One topic becomes 5 pieces of content across different formats — all at once.

```
Topic: [YOUR TOPIC]

Spawn 5 agents in parallel. Each one creates a different piece of content from this topic:

Agent 1: Write a 60-second video script (hook + 3 points + CTA)
Agent 2: Write an Instagram carousel (7 slides — hook, 5 value slides, CTA)
Agent 3: Write a Twitter/X thread (8-10 tweets, hook tweet first)
Agent 4: Write an email newsletter about this topic (subject line + body + CTA)
Agent 5: Write 10 hook variations I could use for this topic across any platform

Use my voice and style from my CLAUDE.md. Make each piece native to its platform — not just copy-pasted across formats.
```

## 3. Client Research (Pre-Sales Call Prep)

Researches a prospect before a sales call so you walk in prepared.

```
I have a sales call with [PROSPECT NAME / COMPANY]. Research them in parallel:

Agent 1: Research their business — what they do, who they serve, their online presence, recent news or activity
Agent 2: Research their industry — trends, challenges, what competitors are doing, market size
Agent 3: Generate my prep — 5 smart questions to ask, 3 ways my service solves their specific problems, potential objections and how to handle them, a personalized opening line

Give me everything organized as a pre-call brief I can review in 2 minutes.
```

## 4. Ad Copy Lab

3 ad variations with different psychological angles — emotional, logical, and curiosity — all written at the same time.

```
I need 3 ad copy variations for [PRODUCT/SERVICE/OFFER]. Spawn 3 agents in parallel:

Agent 1 — EMOTIONAL angle: Lead with pain or desire. Make them FEEL something. Use storytelling. "I was struggling with [X] until..."
Agent 2 — LOGICAL angle: Lead with proof and numbers. Stats, results, ROI. "Here's exactly what happened when..."
Agent 3 — CURIOSITY angle: Lead with an open loop. Make them NEED to click. "The [industry] secret that nobody talks about..."

Each agent should write:
- Primary text (the main ad copy)
- Headline (short, punchy)
- Description (one line under the headline)
- CTA suggestion

Target audience: my audience from my CLAUDE.md. Write in my voice.
```

## 5. Weekly CEO Brief

News, trends, and action items for your business — researched and compiled simultaneously.

```
Give me my weekly CEO brief. Spawn 3 agents in parallel:

Agent 1 — INDUSTRY NEWS: Search the web for the top 5 stories in [YOUR INDUSTRY/NICHE] from this past week. Summarize each in 2-3 sentences. Flag anything that directly affects my business.

Agent 2 — COMPETITOR WATCH: Check what [COMPETITOR 1] and [COMPETITOR 2] have been posting or launching this week. Any new offers? Content shifts? Pricing changes? Summarize what I should know.

Agent 3 — MY ACTION ITEMS: Based on everything you know about my business from my CLAUDE.md, give me: my top 3 priorities this week, 1 quick win I can do today, and 1 trend I should capitalize on before everyone else does.

Compile everything into a clean brief I can read in 3 minutes over coffee.
```

**Pro tip:** You can modify any of these. Add agents, change the tasks, combine workflows. The pattern is always the same — break the work into independent pieces, spawn agents for each one, get everything back at once.

**One person. An entire team's output.** That's the cheat code. 🤖
